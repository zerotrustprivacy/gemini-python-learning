Welcome to the Gemini Python Learning project! This project is designed to help you learn Python programming through a series of structured lessons. Each lesson covers fundamental concepts and includes practical challenges to reinforce your understanding.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **Lessons/**: Contains all the lessons.
  - **Lesson1/**: Introduction to variables and data types.
    - `lesson.md`: Content for the first lesson.
    - `challenge.py`: Coding challenge related to the first lesson.
    - `solution.py`: Solution to the challenge in `challenge.py`.
  - **Lesson2/**: Control structures such as conditionals and loops.
    - `lesson.md`: Content for the second lesson.
    - `challenge.py`: Coding challenge related to the second lesson.
    - `solution.py`: Solution to the challenge in `challenge.py`.
  - **Lesson3/**: Functions and modules in Python.
    - `lesson.md`: Content for the third lesson.
    - `challenge.py`: Coding challenge related to functions and modules.
    - `solution.py`: Solution to the challenge in `challenge.py`.
  - **Lesson4/**: Data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
    - `lesson.md`: Content for the fourth lesson.
    - `challenge.py`: Coding challenge related to data structures.
    - `solution.py`: Solution to the challenge in `challenge.py`.
  - **Lesson5/**: File handling and exceptions in Python.
    - `lesson.md`: Content for the fifth lesson.
    - `challenge.py`: Coding challenge related to file handling and exceptions.
    - `solution.py`: Solution to the challenge in `challenge.py`.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
