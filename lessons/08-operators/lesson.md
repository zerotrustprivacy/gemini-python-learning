# Lesson 8: Operators

Arithmetic:
- +, -, *, /, //, %, **

Comparison:
- ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical:
- and, or, not

Examples:
```python
a, b = 9, 4
sum_ = a + b
diff = a - b
prod = a * b
quot = a / b
mod = a % b

eq = a == b
gt = a > b
le = a <= b

p, q = True, False
both = p and q
either = p or q
neg = not p
```

Augmented assignment:
```python
x = 1
x += 2  # 3
```
