# Gemini Python Learning Space

Welcome to the Gemini Python Learning Space! This repository is designed to provide a structured, hands-on learning environment for Python programming, guided by the Gemini AI Assistant. Our goal is to help you progress from a beginner to an advanced Python developer through a series of self-contained lessons.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a series of lessons, each focusing on a specific topic in Python. The lessons are located in the `lessons/` directory and follow a consistent structure:

- **Lesson Directories**: Each lesson is contained within its own directory, named with a numeric prefix and a descriptive title (e.g., `01-variables-and-data-types`).
- **Required Files**:
  - `lesson.md`: A detailed explanation of the topic with code examples.
  - `challenge.py`: Exercises for you to complete, including a self-checking mechanism.
  - `solution.py`: The official solution to the exercises, with detailed comments.

## Lessons Overview

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Introduction to variables and data types in Python.
2. **Working with Strings**: String manipulation techniques and methods.
3. **Functions and Scope**: Understanding functions, parameters, return values, and scope.
4. **Data Structures**: Overview of lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
5. **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files in Python.
