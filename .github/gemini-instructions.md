Python Learning Space - AI Coding Assistant Instructions
Project Overview
This is a Python learning repository organized around specific language concepts. Each topic gets its own directory with exercises, examples, and documentation. The goal is hands-on learning through practical code examples.

Project Structure & Patterns
Topic-based directories: Each Python concept lives in its own folder (e.g., list-comps/, unpacking/)
Consistent README structure: Every topic directory contains a README.md explaining the concept and containing exercises
Learning progression: Start with README explanations, then build practical examples
Single entry point: main.py serves as a simple project runner
Development Environment
Python 3.13 (see .python-version)
Virtual environment: .venv/ for isolated dependencies
uv/pip: Dependency management via pyproject.toml
Key Workflows
Creating New Learning Topics
Create new directory: mkdir new-topic/
Add README with concept explanation: echo "# Learning [Topic] in Python\n\nIn this folder you will find notes, exercises, snippets, and examples related to [topic] in Python." > new-topic/README.md
Build examples as separate .py files within the topic directory
Running Code
Topic examples: Run individual Python files within topic directories
Virtual environment: Always activate .venv before running code
File Organization
Notes: Use README.md for concept explanations and exercise descriptions
AI Assistant Guidelines
When helping with this codebase:

Maintain topic isolation: Keep each concept in its dedicated directory
Follow naming patterns: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the Python concept being demonstrated
Provide progressive examples: Start simple, then build complexity within each topic
Include explanatory comments: Code should be educational with clear comments explaining Python concepts
Update READMEs: When adding new examples, reference them in the topic's README.md
Use modern Python: Target Python 3.13 features and best practices
