# gemini-python-learning

Welcome to your personal Python learning space, supercharged by Gemini! This repository is designed to take you from a Python newbie to a pro, one lesson at a time.

This project is inspired by the [python-learning-space](https://github.com/madebygps/python-learning-space) by @madebygps and the book "Think Python, 3rd Edition" by Allen Downey.

## How It Works

This repository is set up as a [VS Code Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), which provides a complete, isolated, and consistent development environment. It ensures you have all the right tools and extensions without needing to install Python or anything else on your local machine.

### Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
    *   [Gemini Code Assist in VS Code](https://codeassist.google/)

2.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine.

3.  **Open in VS Code**: Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code. You should see a pop-up in the bottom-right corner asking if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click it.

4.  **Start Learning**: VS Code will build the container and install the necessary extensions. Once it's ready, navigate to the `lessons` directory and start with the first lesson!

## Lessons

Each lesson is contained in its own folder and includes:
*   `lesson.md`: An explanation of the concepts.
*   `challenge.py`: A file with exercises for you to complete.
*   `solution.py`: The official solution to the challenge.

### Current Lessons
*   Lesson 1: Variables and Data Types
