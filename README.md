# üöÄ Python Learning Space üöÄ

Welcome!

This isn't just another tutorial; it's your personal coding dojo, designed to be a structured, hands-on learning environment. With Gemini as your AI coding partner, you'll tackle challenges, understand complex topics, and build a solid foundation in Python.

This project is inspired by the [python-learning-space](https://github.com/madebygps/python-learning-space) by @madebygps and the book "Think Python, 3rd Edition" by Allen Downey.

## How It Works

This repository is set up as a [VS Code Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), which provides a complete, isolated, and consistent development environment. It ensures you have all the right tools and extensions without needing to install Python or anything else on your local machine.

### Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
    *   [Gemini Code Assist](https://codeassist.google/)

2.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine.

3.  **Open in VS Code**: Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code. You should see a pop-up in the bottom-right corner asking if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click it.

4.  **Start Learning**: VS Code will build the container and install the necessary extensions. Once it's ready, navigate to the `lessons` directory and start with the first lesson!

## üìö Lesson Plan

Each lesson folder contains three key files:
*   `lesson.md`: The concepts and theory.
*   `challenge.py`: The hands-on exercises for you to solve.
*   `solution.py`: The official answers (but no peeking until you've tried!).
